# The Team Comes Together

February 2025 marked a pivotal moment for PastForward when Alexandra, Jona, and Laura met online for the first time to officially form our founding team.

## The Meeting

During this crucial virtual meeting, Alexandra and Jona presented the comprehensive vision for PastForward to Laura, including:

- **Project concept** and mission to transform archaeological careers
- **Brand identity** including the name "PastForward" and initial design concepts
- **Platform features** and community-building approach
- **Timeline** for development and launch

## Laura Joins the Team

Laura's extensive experience in campaign building and community organizing made her the perfect addition to our team. Her expertise in crowdfunding and her deep understanding of the challenges facing archaeologists brought essential skills to the project.

## Defining Roles

The meeting established clear areas of focus for each team member:

- **Alexandra:** Marketing, events, and community outreach
- **Jona:** Design, web development, and technical implementation
- **Laura:** Crowdfunding campaigns and financial strategy

## Shared Vision

Despite coming from different backgrounds within archaeology, all three founders shared a common experience: the frustration of navigating an unclear, unsupportive career landscape. This shared understanding became the foundation for everything we're building.

## Looking Forward

This meeting transformed PastForward from an idea into a concrete project with dedicated leadership. The chemistry and shared commitment evident in this first meeting continues to drive our work today.

The formation of our core team marked the moment when PastForward became more than just a concept - it became a movement with the people and passion needed to create real change in archaeology.
