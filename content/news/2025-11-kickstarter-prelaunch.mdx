# Kickstarter Campaign Prelaunched

We have prelaunched our Kickstarter campaign. This is an important step for PastForwardHub as we work to build a platform that serves the archaeological community.

The campaign is in prelaunch mode right now, which means you can follow the project and get notified when we officially launch. Early followers help us build momentum for launch day, and this support makes a real difference in how the campaign performs once it goes live.

## Why We're Using Kickstarter

We are using Kickstarter to fund the initial development of PastForwardHub. This approach lets us build the platform with direct input from the archaeological community from day one. Your support will help us create tools that actually work for archaeologists, not just what we think you need. We want to build something useful, and that means listening to the people who will use it.

## How You Can Help Right Now

Visit our [Kickstarter page](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pastforwardhub/pastforwardhub-for-archaeologists-by-archaeologists?ref=discovery&term=pastforwardhub&total_hits=1&category_id=342) and click "Notify me on launch" to stay updated. Share it with colleagues who might be interested. Every follow counts and helps us reach more people in the community.

We are preparing for the official launch over the week. We will share more details about our funding goals, rewards, and timeline as we get closer. Follow the campaign to stay in the loop, and thanks for your support as we build this platform for archaeologists, by archaeologists.
