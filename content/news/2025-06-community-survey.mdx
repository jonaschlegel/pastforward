# Community Survey Now Live

We've launched our comprehensive community survey to better understand the challenges facing archaeologists worldwide. Your input will directly influence the design and features of the PastForwardHub platform.

## Your Voice Matters

The survey covers key areas including:

- Career development challenges
- Networking and community needs
- Platform feature priorities
- Work-life balance in archaeology

## Anonymous and Quick

The survey takes just 3-5 minutes to complete and is completely anonymous. Every response helps us build a platform that truly serves the archaeological community.
