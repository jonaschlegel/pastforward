# The IKEA Sketchbook Moment

Every good project has an origin story. For PastForwardHub, it began with a coffee meeting at IKEA in Vienna (Austria), where two archaeologists met up after .

## The Meeting

In November 2024, Alexandra and Jona arranged to meet for coffee while both were in Vienna. What started as a casual catch-up between colleagues quickly evolved into something much more significant.

## The Napkin Sketch

Over coffee and Swedish meatballs, the conversation turned to the shared frustrations they'd both experienced in their archaeological careers:

- **Contract uncertainty** and the constant search for the next opportunity
- **Lack of clear career progression** paths in archaeology
- **Isolation** experienced by many professionals in the field
- **Scattered resources** and missed connections

As they talked, Jona began sketching ideas on a napkin. The rough drawings showed interconnected circles representing archaeologists, arrows indicating career paths, and boxes symbolizing resources and opportunities.

## The "What If" Moment

The breakthrough came when Alexandra asked: "What if we could create a platform that addresses all of these problems at once?"

That simple question sparked hours of discussion about:

- **Community building** tools for archaeologists
- **Career pathway mapping** across different sectors
- **Resource centralization** and opportunity sharing
- **Mentorship and support networks**

## From Napkin to Vision

By the end of the meeting, that napkin contained the essential DNA of what would become PastForward Hub:

- A platform **by archaeologists, for archaeologists**
- **Community-driven** development and features
- **Transparent** and **supportive** rather than competitive
- **Inclusive** of all archaeological career paths

## The Name

Even the name emerged from this conversation. "PastForward" perfectly captured the essence of what they wanted to create: using our shared understanding of archaeology's challenges to build a better future for the field.

## Historical Significance

That napkin, now carefully preserved, represents more than just the start of a project. It symbolizes the power of bringing archaeologists together to imagine new possibilities for our field.

The IKEA meeting proved that sometimes the most important archaeological discoveries happen not in the field, but over coffee when passionate people decide to act on their shared vision for change.
